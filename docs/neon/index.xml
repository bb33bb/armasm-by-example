Many times in computing you need to do the same operation to a set of data. This could include color correcting pixels on a screen, running a cryptography algorithm, and determining reflection/blur results. For the longest time, processors were limited to calculating these with one instruction that resulted in one data point.</description></item><item><title>Program 21: Bus Rider</title><link>https://armasm.com/docs/neon/bus-rider/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://armasm.com/docs/neon/bus-rider/</guid><description>This is, without a doubt, a simple introductory program to use the NEON co-processor. It has all kinds of uses but I wanted to find something that was both simple and more concrete then &amp;ldquo;LOOK HOW COOL IT IS WHEN WE USE RANDOM NUMBERS TO DO RAY TRACING!!&amp;rdquo; A little backgrounds on matrices first if you don&amp;rsquo;t know how they can be solved.
Matrices # If you think back to linear algebra, you will probably remember a small part where you were working with matrices.</description></item></channel></rss>
